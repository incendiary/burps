Some burp plugins

*BurpXHookSignature*

First attempt at one, mostly taken from [forgenix](https://www.foregenix.com/blog/testing-problematic-authorisation-tokens-with-burp)

ran into trouble renaming NAME = "Bearer Authorization Token" but got it working in limited time, maybe it will become apparent with time ;-)
